# Design Process

# Topic decision
Looking at the examples provided the best option appeared to be the gaming industry. Since this is a topic I am already familiar with.
To narrow the focus a little I decided to make the website direct its focus on the VR gaming industry.

# Web Page design
I decided to split the assignment up into sections, with the assumption of having 4 or 5 different focuses on the different parts of the VR industry.
This section idea allowed for me to have different ways of displaying the information in interesting and unique ways.
The next design focus was the key themes I had to decide on; color, style and design. The first decision was to have a parallax background, displaying the shift to a different section.
Color was difficult with many different colors being a part of this task, trying to have a theme for the parallax sections and the white background sections.
With the theme also trying to be related or coherent with the topic of VR.


# Comments on each section
# Heading and Nav bar
Both the heading and the nav bar turned out quite nice with the only issue being the nav bar doesn’t blend as well as I would like with the rest of the page.

# Section 1 and 5
These sections were designed to be simple blocks of text and images to not overwhelm the user with fancy visual effects and controls. 
They are meant as introduction and conclusion to the project, tying the page together and be key informational sections.

# Section 2
This section has quite a nice design but has a few core issues; firstly the images are quite small so it is hard to see as well as the space for the text is rather limited.
Leading to the second problem of this section being the least dynamic as if the screen was any smaller the text will not remain inside the box.

# Section 3
Was rather simple in nature with it just being a bunch of rotating images (though the implementation was not easy). This led to the section lacking any information about what the products were, 
how they impact the industry and other such information.

# Section 4
This section was the focus of the javascript displaying all required attributes from the rubric. This was the most difficult part of the assignment, 
requiring quite a lot of outside research to implement correctly with markers and information tabs. 
Unfortunately Canberra lacks a lot of VR based rooms/businesses, leading to a rather empty map.
